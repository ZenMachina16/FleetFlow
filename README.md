This project implements dynamic route optimization for fleet management using priority-based pathfinding and heuristic algorithm of Travelling Salesman Problem. The system ensures efficient delivery by adjusting routes in real time based on priority destinations.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

## Priority-Based Optimization: Routes start from high-priority locations if detected.

## Dynamic Rerouting: If another truck is assigned to a priority location, the first truck is redirected.

## Heuristic Pathfinding: ACO is used to optimize routes efficiently.

## Real-Time Monitoring: Optimized routes are assigned, and GPS tracking is enabled for live monitoring.

## ðŸ“· Workflow Overview:
The following flowchart illustrates the route optimization process:

This system thus enhances delivery efficiency, reduces fuel consumption, and improves fleet utilization
